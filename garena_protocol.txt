1 Intro

1.1 Status of this documentation

The following informations were found by reverse engineering (disassembly of
the Garena client, and networking sniffing). The tools used were: IDA pro,
tcpdump, wireshark, netcat, and OpenSSL.

Because it is based on reverse engineering, this documentation is still
incomplete. But there is enough info to connect to a server, join a room,
talk in room, and play games. Successful tests have been made with Left 4
Dead (dedicated L4D linux server) and Warcraft III. 

1.2 Protocol overview

There is 2 types of Garena Servers: main servers, and room servers. The
Garena clients connect to the main server when you connect to garena, and
connects to the room server when you join a room. 

Garena uses 3 different protocols: 

- The Garena Server Protocol (GSP) is used for talking to the main server. This
  protocol handles authentication, and probably client version checking and
  friends management. This protocol uses TCP port 7456 and is "encrypted" (I
  put this in quotes since, as you will see later, this encryption is
  totally worthless). 

- The Garena Chat Room Protocol (GCRP) is used for talking to the room
  server. This protocol handles room joining, and room traffic (such as
  people publicly talking on the room). This protocol uses TCP port 8687.

- The Garena Peer To Peer Protocol (GP2PP) is used for communicating with
  others Garena Clients. This protocol handles client-to-client direct
  traffic, such as private messages and VPN (game) packets. This protocol
  uses UDP port 1513 by default, but it can be configured. The GP2PP protocol
  is also used to perform the IP/port lookup and query the number of members
  in each room.


Each Garena user is identified by a User ID, which is used in all the 3
protocols. 

Each room is identified by a Room ID. The list of rooms and their IDs and
the IPs of their room servers are in a file distributed with Garena and
named roomEN.dat, which is actually a standard SQLite database. 

Each room is associated with a VPN. Each user on the room has a (room-unique)
IP address in the subnet 192.168.29.0/24. Two users are in the same VPN if
they are in the same room. The VPN can be used to carry virtual UDP, and
establish/use/close virtual TCP connections between members. Because of
protocols limitations, it is not possible to use VPN from the same account
on two rooms at the same time.

1.3 Exemple of a typical session


- The Garena Client connects to the main server on TCP port 7456. Using GSP,
  it sends username & password to the main server, and the server accepts.
  Among other things, the server sends the User ID to the client. 

- The Garena Client sends a GP2PP message to main server on UDP port 1513 to
  perform IP/port lookup. The main server replies to the client, indicating
  the client's external ip and port. The client records the informations
  (this is useful in case of NAT, the clients may not know its local
  ip/port). 

- The Garena Client sends a GP2PP message to main server on UDP port 1513
  to query room usage info. The main server replies to the client,
  indicating the number of users in each room. 

[The IP/port lookup and the room usage query are the only times we use GP2PP
with a host that is not another garena client] 

- The user wants to connect to a room. The room server IP and room ID are found
  in the roomEN.dat file. The client connects to the room server on TCP port
  8687. Using GCRP it sends the Room ID to the room server, along with his
  user name, user ID, password and other informations). The room server
  accepts the join, sends to the client the Welcome Message, and the Room
  Member List. The Member List includes each member's name, user ID,
  experience level, and IP/ports. 

- The Garena Client uses GP2PP to send a HELLO message to each member of the
  room. It also replies to any GP2PP HELLO message received from a member.
  Once HELLO a member has replied to one of our HELLO message, we can know
  his ping, and we can exchange useful packets (VPN game packets) with him. 

- The user wants to start a game. The Garena Client sends a GCRP message to
  the room server to enable the VPN. This message is forwarded by the room
  server to the other members. The other members start sending us GP2PP
  packets containing VPN traffic (encapsulated UDP, and virtual TCP
  connections).

- The user plays the game, all the game packets are forwarded by the Garena
  Clients in both directions via the GP2PP protocol with other members.

- When the user stops the game, the Garena Client sends a GCRP message to
  the room server, indicating that the VPN is now off. The other members see
  this message, and stop sending us the GP2PP VPN packets. 
 
- The client sends a GCRP message to the room server to leave the room, and
  disconnect the TCP session

- The clients disconnect the main server TCP session. 


1.4 Some important notes 

Some fields in the protocol will me marked as MBZ (Must Be Zero). These
fields have been observed to be 0 in all the packet captures. 

Some fields have been marked "unknown". If it is in a message to the client,
it means that we should ignore this field. If it is in a message to be sent,
usually it is explained what to put in these fields.

A lot of fields represents integers. Unless specified, the integers are in
Little Endian. The integers that represents TCP/UDP port numbers are
sometime in Little Endian, and sometime in Big Endian, depending on the
message type (what a crappy protocol). In this document, the endianness will
be specified, each time we encounter such cases.


2 The Garena Server Protocol

2.1 Concepts

To connect to the server, the client must first do the Session opening,
involving cryptographic key exchange. Then, Hello message are exchanged.
Then, the client sends Authentication info to the server, and the server
replies. These steps are described in the following subsections.

2.1.1 Session opening

To connect to the server, the client must connect to the main server on TCP
port 7456 and perform session opening. 

For the session opening, the client generates a 256-bits AES session key, and a
128-bits AES session IV (Initialisation Vector). 

The client sends a GSP SESSION INIT message to the server, encrypted with
the client's RSA private key (that is, encrypted with the *private* key). 
The RSA private key is the same for all Garena Clients, has been ripped 
from the windows EXE, and is given at the end of this file :)
Because of this, the encryption is worthless: if someone is able to sniff
the GSP session, he can get the encrypted GSP SESSION INIT message, decrypt
it with the RSA public key (which can be derived from the RSA private key
very easily with OpenSSL), and so get the AES session key and IV. 

After the GSP SESSION INIT message, all the other GSP messages are encrypted
in AES CBC with the session key and IV. The key and IV stay the same during
all the session, in both directions (that is, the IV used for the encryption
of each subsequent message is really the *starting IV* and not the last 
ciphertext block like it should be).

After this, the server replies with an encrypted GSP SESSION INIT REPLY message. 

2.1.2 Hello

After the session opening, the clients sends a GSP HELLO message to the main
server, and the main server replies with another GSP HELLO message. It is
not clear what is the purpose of these messages, it appears to be used to
check that the client is up to date. 

2.1.3 Authentication

After the hello, the clients sends a GSP LOGIN message to the main server.
This message contains the username and password (hashed as MD5), and also 
the local (LAN) IP and port of the client. This info will be used by GP2PP, 
like explained later. 

The main server replies with a GSP LOGIN REPLY message indicating success,
or with a GSP LOGIN FAIL indicating a problem with the authentication.

The GSP LOGIN REPLY contains infos that will be sent when connecting to the
room servers: username, user ID, country, experience level, ...

2.2 Message formats

All GSP messages except SESSION INIT are AES-encrypted, and so, their
plaintext size is a multiple of the AES block size (which is 16 bytes). If 
the plaintext size is not a multiple of 16, the remaining bytes are filled
by a padding value. The padding value varies between message types. 

The outgoing message formats are usually well described, because we need to
generate our own. For the incoming messages, we describe only the fields we
need for the client, the other infos can be safely ignored.

2.2.0 Format of the MYINFO block

This is not a message, but this block is used in more than one message, so I
figured I should put a common definition.

  When sending a message containing a MYINFO block, the client should
  fill the correct value.

Bytes 42..43:
  Internal GP2PP port of the client.
  Stored in big endian. 
  When receiving a message containing a MYINFO block, the client should

3 The Garena Chat Room Protocol

3.1 Concepts

The client must first join a room. Then, the client may exchange room
traffic messages. The details are described in the following sections. 

3.1.1 Joining a room

To connect to a room, the client must connect to the room server on TCP port
8687 and send a GCRP ME JOIN message.

The GCRP ME JOIN message contains the room ID, the username, the user ID, the
user password, the country, the experience level, the internal/external IP
and port. Some info will cause rejection by the room server if incorrect
(like username or password); some info will be ignored by the room server
(like experience level - spoofing it doesn't work), and some info will be
accepted by the room server (like the internal ip/port, and the external
port). The password is sent in a MD5 hash, and the other fields are put in a
block that is compressed using the deflate algorithm (implemented in zlib).
This compressed block is checksummed using a CRC32, even though it is
useless (since this is over TCP). 

The room server either rejects the join and sends a GCRP JOIN FAILED
message, or accepts the join.

In the latter case, the room server sends a GCRP WELCOME message, specifying
the room welcome message.

The room server also sends (the order is not specified) a GCRP MEMBERS
message specyifing the list of members in the room. For each member, the
following info is sent: 
- User ID
- User Name
- User Country Code
- Experience Level
- VPN status (if the users is playing currently or not)
- External (WAN, post-NAT) IP
- Internal (LAN, pre-NAT) IP
- External (WAN, post-NAT) GP2PP port
- Internal (LAN, pre-NAT) GP2PP port
- Virtual IP (in the range 192.168.29.0/24)

3.1.2 Room traffic 

Room traffic messages represents various actions on the room, like
joining/leaving the channel, talking, and enabling/disabling the VPN (when a
user starts or stop a game). Room traffic messages can be both sent or
received, with the exception of the GCRP JOIN message, that can be only
received: that is because when we want to join a room, we send the GCRP ME
JOIN message, and not the GCRP JOIN message. The GCRP JOIN message is only 
for the room server informing us that another user joined. 

List of Room Traffic messages with their parameters (unknown fields are not
shown):

GCRP JOIN:
- User ID
- User Name
- User Country Code
- Experience Level
- VPN status (if the users is playing currently or not)
- External (WAN, post-NAT) IP
- Internal (LAN, pre-NAT) IP
- External (WAN, post-NAT) GP2PP port
- Internal (LAN, pre-NAT) GP2PP port
- Virtual IP (in the range 192.168.29.0/24)

GCRP TALK:
- Room ID
- User ID
- Message text

GCRP PART:
- User ID

GCRP START VPN
- User ID

GCRP STOP VPN
- User ID


3.2 Message formats

3.2.0 MEMBER INFO block

This block is not a message, but it is found in more than one message, so it
has a common definition here.

MEMBER INFO block format:

Bytes 0..3:
  User ID, in little endian.

Bytes 4..19:
  User name, NULL-terminated string.
  When it receives this block, it should be prepared to handle the case when 
  it is not null terminated.

Bytes 20..21:
  User country, NOT null terminated.

Bytes 22..23:
  Must be zero.

Byte 24:
  Unknown

Byte 25:
  Experience level;

Byte 26:
  Unknown

Byte 27:
  Set to 1 if the user is currently playing (VPN enabled), else set to 0

Byte 28..31:
  External IP of the client.
  Stored using standard network byte-order format.

Byte 32..35:
  Ditto, for Internal IP address

3.2.1 GCRP ME JOIN 

Bytes 0..3:
  Message size in little endian (excluding this field)

Byte 4:
  JOIN message type identifier.
  This is 0x22.

Bytes 5..8:
  Room ID in little endian.

Bytes 9..12:
  Must be zero.

Bytes 13..16:
  (Length of MYINFO block + length of CRC field), in little endian.

Bytes 17..20:
  Checksum of the MYINFO block. Algorithm CRC32B, as found in mhash lib. 

Starting at byte 21:
  MYINFO block, compressed with the Deflate algorithm, as found in zlib. 
  This MYINFO block should contain the same informations as the MYINFO block
  received with the LOGIN REPLY message. In particular, the "unknown" fields
  of the MYINFO block should be the same as the ones received in the LOGIN
  REPLY message.
  HOWEVER, the exceptions are the external/internal IP and ports: the client
  should send the ip and ports that it has determined with IP/port lookup
  and getsockname(), rather than copying the ip and ports received with the
  LOGIN REPLY message. 

Directly after the compressed MYINFO block, there is the ME JOIN SUFFIX
block, whose format is:

Bytes 0..14:
  Must be zero.

Byte 9..12:
  Sender's User ID, in little endian.

Byte 13..16:
  Text string length. The length does not count the NULL terminating
  character, but each character counts for 2 bytes (see below). 
  In fact this field is useless because we know the total message size, but
  on outgoing messages we have to set it anyway to be compatible...

Bytes 17..end:
  The text message typed by the user on the room.
  Null-terminated text string, probably encoded in UTF-16. The
  NULL-terminating char is 16-bits wide, too... 
  The client should be prepared to handle the case when this string is not
  null-terminated, but when sending this message type, the client should set
  a null-terminated string.

4 The Garena Peer To Peer Protocol

4.1 Concepts

GP2PP messages are usually exchanged with others clients. The only
exceptions are:

- the IP/port lookup
- the Room usage query

The IP/port lookup and Room usage query occurs when the client connects,
before any room is joined. This is discussed in the section 4.1.1. Other
usages of the GP2PP protocol (that is, exchange with others clients) occurs
when we are in a room, and that is discussed in section 4.1.2. 

The GP2PP protocol implements a mechanism for NAT traversal. All the GP2PP 
messages must be sent from the same local port (usually 1513), disobeying 
this rule will cause problems with NAT traversal.

4.1.1 Messages exchanged with the main server

The IP/Port lookup and Room usage query must be done before any channel is
joined, but they may be done in any order.

4.1.1.1 IP/Port lookup

The GP2PP protocol uses the UDP port 1513 both on local end and remote end.
Because of NAT, the local IP address (as seen by our client) may not be the
same as the external IP address (as seen by others hosts). The local UDP
port (1513) may also be remapped by the NAT box. This is why the IP/Port
lookup is necessary to enable the client to know his external IP and Port.
To do this, the client sends a GP2PP IP_LOOKUP message to the main
server. The main server receive the message and records the source IP 
address and port, then sends back a GP2PP IP_LOOKUP_REPLY message to the 
client, containing the correct external IP and port. 


4.1.1.2 Room usage query

The Room ID is 24-bits, and can be split into Room ID prefix (most
significant 16bits) and Room ID suffix (least significant 8bits). 

To know how many users there are in each room, the client must send a GP2PP
ROOM_USAGE to the main server on UDP port 1513. 

For each existing Room ID prefix, the server will send a GP2PP ROOM_USAGE_REPLY
to the client. The message gives the usage count of all the rooms that have
this prefix, by listing all their suffixes along with the corresponding usage 
count.

4.1.2 Messages exchanged with other clients

Before any other things, two clients must exchange GP2PP HELLO messages.
This allows each client to know each other's ping, and plays an important
role on NAT traversal. 

Then, the clients can exchange GP2PP packets to handle Virtual UDP datagrams
and Virtual TCP streams on the VPN associated with the room the clients are
on. Each client on the room has a virtual IP in 192.168.29.XXX, this virtual
IP can be known from the virtual suffix field in the GCRP JOIN and GCRP
MEMBERS messages. When a game to send or receive UDP or TCP data from/to one
of these virtual IP addresses, the Garena client will instead handle this
traffic by exchanging the right GP2PP messages with the corresponding
clients.

4.1.2.1 HELLOs and NAT traversal

At regular intervals, the client will send a GP2PP HELLO message to all the 
others client on the room. The client should send the GP2PP HELLO message to
other clients on their external ip/port, and on their internal ip/port
(these informations are given by the GCRP protocol, especially by GCRP JOIN
and GCRP MEMBERS messages). This ensures that the remote client receive the
HELLO message regardless of whether he is on the LAN or not (i.e. it manages
the situation when two Garena users play from the same LAN). 

When other clients replies (with GP2PP HELLO REPLY messages) to our local
client, our local client must record the source IP and port. Thus, from now
on, when we need to send a GP2PP message to that client, we know what is
the IP and port we need to send to (and so we do not need to send the
messages both on the external and internal addresses). 

When our local client receives a GP2PP HELLO message, it must respond a 
GP2PP HELLO_REPLY to the source IP and port. 

When a client sends a GP2PP HELLO message, and the client is behind a NAT
box, it will cause the NAT router to allow incoming replies to this message,
provided that the source and destination IP/ports match. When a client sends
a GP2PP message, it tries to use always the same source port, precisely the
port that was used in the IP/Port lookup phase of the main server
connection, and this is the info that is published in the GCRP JOIN and 
GCRP MEMBERS messages. 
Because of that, when two clients behind NAT exchange GP2PP HELLO 
messages, the source IP/port of the client 1 will be the destination IP/port
of the client 2, and vice versa. Thus, after one exchange, both NAT routers
will allow incoming messages from the remote client. This mechanism enables
two Garena users behind NAT boxes to communicate without having to configure
any port forwarding, as long as the external source ports remains the same
all the time.


4.1.2.2 Virtual UDP

Sending a virtual (encapsulated) UDP datagram to another client is very 
simple: we need to send a GP2PP UDP ENCAP message to the remote client. This
message contains the following informations:
- the sender's User ID
- the virtual UDP source port 
- the virtual UDP destination port
- the virtual UDP payload (actual UDP data) 

The virtual UDP source and destination ports are the ports as seen in the
VPN, not the source/destination ports of the GP2PP packet. 

Virtual UDP are received in a similar fashion. It can be noted that the
GP2PP UDP ENCAP message does not contain the virtual source and destination
IPs. Indeed, this is useless because the virtual source IP can be retrieved
from the User ID, together with the user informations sent by GCRP JOIN and
GCRP MEMBERS messages. Likewise, when we need to send a datagram to a
virtual IP, we need to lookup the room member that has the desired virtual
suffix.


4.1.2.3 Virtual TCP

The Virtual TCP is reliable and connection-oriented, and handles connection establishment, 
data exchange (and acknowledgmements), and connection teardown. 

The description of this protocol assumes that you are familiar with the TCP
protocol. If not, please read the RFC793. 

a) Connection establishment

To establish a connection, the client sends a GP2PP INITCONN message to the
other client. This message contains the following informations:
- Connection ID
- Destination port

The Connection ID is a 32-bit number that identifies this virtual
connection. Apparently, the Garena windows client always picks the connection 
ID such that (conn_id >> 16) == ((conn_id & 0xFFFF) + 1). I have no fucking 
idea why, but apparently it is so. 

This message is unconfirmed, once a client has sent a GP2PP INITCONN message, 
for his point of view, the connection is established. The connection is
established from the point of view of the receiver, as soon as it has got
the GP2PP INITCONN message. If the receiver does not want the connection,
he has to close it using a GP2PP CONN FIN message (see later). Strangely,
the Windows clients does not send GP2PP CONN FIN message even if we try to
connect to it on a closed TCP port, but any sane implementation should do it...
 
b) Connection data exchange

To send a data packet on a Virtual TCP connection, the client must send to
the other client a GP2PP CONN DATA message. This message contains the
following important informations:
- Connection ID (the same as the Connection ID used in the INITCONN)
- This packet's sequence number (SEQ)
- Our current acknowledgmenet number (ACK)
- Obviously, the packet payload

The SEQ and ACK are used like in TCP, but they always start at 0 (and are
not randonly initialized like with TCP), and they count number of packets,
not number of bytes (and so, it's not possible to partially acknowledge a
packet). The SEQ represents this packet's sequence number, while the ACK
represents the next SEQ expected from the peer (like in TCP). 

The sender should keep the sent packets until they are acknowledged (that
is, until it receives a packet a greater ACK), to retransmit them after a
timeout if they are lost. 
 
c) Data acknowledgement, and Fast Retransmission

When a client receive a data packet, and the data packet is new (it is not a
duplicate of an already-received pacet), it should reply a GP2PP CONN ACK
message (this is not clear if it is mandatory or not, since the ACK is
already conveyed by the CONN DATA messages... but sending CONN ACK messages
allows us to do Fast Retransmission as we will see later, and thus enable a
faster recovery in case of packet loss. Clients written based on this spec
should send CONN ACK messages for every CONN DATA received, but should also
tolerate that the peer doesn't do so, by taking into account the ACK field
in the CONN DATA messages). 

The CONN DATA message contains two informations:
- The Connection ID
- The Sequence number of the packet we are acknowledging (SEQ)
- Our current acknowledgement number (ACK)


When a client receive a CONN ACK packet, it should interpretet the ACK field 
like in the CONN DATA message, and mark all the sent packets whose sequence
numbers are inferior to the ACK field, as acknowledged. Furthermore, it should
mark the packet whose sequence number is exactly equal to the SEQ field, as
acknowledged. 

If ACK number is less than SEQ+1, this means that packets sent by the
client with sequence numbers between ACK and (SEQ-1) included were lost.
Indeed, the CONN ACK message tells us that the peer received the packet number
SEQ, but that the next packet it expects must have sequence number ACK. In
that case, the client should fast-retransmit all these packets, to prevent
lag due to timeout before standard retransmission. Fast-retransmission
should be done only once for each packet. If the fast-retransmission fails
to deliver the packet, wait for the standard retransmission. 

d) Connection teardown

To close the connection, the client shall send a GP2PP CONN CLOSE message to
the peer, containing the following informations:
- Connection ID

The Windows Garena implementation sends the GP2PP CONN CLOSE message four
times, I have no idea why. A reimplementation of the client based on the
present document shall send the GP2PP CONN CLOSE four times too, but
tolerate that other implementations may send it one, two, three, or four 
times.
